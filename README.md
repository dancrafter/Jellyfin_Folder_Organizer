# Jellyfin_Folder_Organizer
A Powershell Jellyfin media Folder Organizer Script for Movie's. 
The Script currently works best with Files exported with MakeMKV

The base Folder Sturcture before the Script should be:
Base Directory
  Movie1 Directory
    Movie.mkv
  Movie2 Directory
    Movie.mkv

In the Script you must define the $baseDirectory. 
The Scipt will ask during runtime for the Date and Resulution and change the file Names acordingly. 

Currently this Powershell Script is missing some features: 
  every Videofile will be .mkv
  you cant skip a Movie Folder during Date input

Features that could be nice: 
  automatic Database check for example IMDB.

This Script is currently manly for my own Media Organizing, feel free to ad to it. 
But i must warn every User, I won't be checking every pupblished Update so **use this Script at your own Risk** and always read through any Script you Download.
